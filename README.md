## Project Overview
The Reverse Psychology Bot takes user input (e.g., "I want to go hiking") and responds with a playful counterargument (e.g., "Hiking? Sounds exhausting, and you might get lost!"). It uses:

Flask: Backend web framework.
Cohere API: Generates reverse psychology responses (free tier, no bank details required).
Tailwind CSS: For a clean, responsive UI.
Railway: Hosting platform for deployment (free tier).

The app is live at your-app-name.up.railway.app (replace with your actual Railway URL after deployment).
Prerequisites

Python 3.9+ (download from python.org)
A Cohere API key (sign up at cohere.ai, free tier, no bank details needed)
Git and a GitHub account
Railway account (sign up at railway.app, free tier, no bank details needed)
